# wallscroll

A rust application for randomizing and shuffling through every image in a given directory. Made for linux/unix operating systems. Officially supported for Arch based distros.

# Current TODO:

- Get arguments read in
- Recurse through given folder
- Make file in $USER/config/wallscroll
- Use this file for iterating over every image type (jpeg, png probably)
- Cycle with every call!
